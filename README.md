Various helpers for PowerShell scripts I have found useful. Currently consists of the following modules:

## [ExecutionSteps](ExecutionSteps)

[![PowerShell Gallery Version](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/v/ExecutionSteps?label=PowerShell%20Gallery&logo=powershell&logoColor=%23b7c1cb&color=%230073c7)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExecutionSteps/) [![Badge for ExecutionSteps build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/birjj/powershell-script-helpers/test_ExecutionSteps.yml?label=ExecutionSteps%20tests&logo=github&logoColor=%23b7c1cb)](https://github.com/birjj/powershell-script-helpers/actions/workflows/test_ExecutionSteps.yml)

Provides the ExecutionStep class, which allows execution of a script as a series of steps.

## [TerminalUI](TerminalUI)

[![PowerShell Gallery Version](https://img.shields.io/powershellgallery/v/TerminalUI?label=PowerShell%20Gallery&logo=powershell&logoColor=%23b7c1cb&color=%230073c7)](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/TerminalUI/) [![Badge for TerminalUI build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/birjj/powershell-script-helpers/test_TerminalUI.yml?label=TerminalUI%20tests&logo=github&logoColor=%23b7c1cb)](https://github.com/birjj/powershell-script-helpers/actions/workflows/test_TerminalUI.yml)

Various CLI-based user interfaces that attempt to improve on the built-in PowerShell variants, including better variants of `Read-Host` and `$Host.UI.PromptForChoice`.
